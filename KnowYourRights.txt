"Knowledge is Power" - Francis Bacon

Why is it important to know your legal rights?
It is important that every person know their individual rights 
because these rights are MEANT TO PROTECT every one of them, for 
them to APPRECIATE THE FREEDOM they have,for them to EMPOWER OTHER 
PEOPLE especially the weak, and for them to STAND UP FOR THEMSELVES 
because every individual have the right to be treated just live everybody 
else no matter what age, race, color, religion, sexual preference or 
socio-economic status they have because in the eyes of the law EVERYONE IS EQUAL.
