			<p class="content">	Eleven letters, two words, one universal right –Human Rights. Every nation has its own definition of Human rights, but the important thing is, we live in our day to day life with freedom and equal treatment because we are entitled in these kind of rights. Human Rights are for everyone, it is a definition of dignity through a human law, a law stating that no one can deprive your right to live.</p>

			<p class="content">However, many of us are suffering from lack of rights which causes many issues. The bad thing about this is we sometimes abuse and misuse our rights where we commit unlawful and disrespectful actions which  are against the right of every human being. Sexual and physical abuse, violence, and exploitation, these are some of the violations that make the world disturbed and imbalanced. It can occur at home, in the street, in the school, practically everywhere. We live in a world with such kind rights but we cannot say that this world is safe, calm, and quiet. We live in the world with poor protection for its people and full of crimes; a world with lack of equality and full of discrimination.</p>
			
			<p class="content">I was born in this world with free and equal dignity; I am a citizen of the world; I am a human being; I deserve a proper and equal treatment because I OWN A RIGHT.</p>

			<p class="heading">I am Different</p>
			<p class="content">	Article III, Section I of the 1987 revised Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines states that “No person shall be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law nor shall any person be denied the equal protection of the law”. But how can we say that this is sufficient to cover the right and protection of everyone, especially the LGBT Community? The LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender) Community is frequently challenged by the struggles and disadvantages it faces in accordance to human rights. Different human perspectives seemed to be a factor why until now, it is still hard for them to get a career, rights for marriage, and universal freedom. Human Right is for everyone. Furthermore, LGBT Rights are also Human Rights which advocate equality and non-discrimination.</p>

			<p class="content">	Concentrating in the Philippines, the LGBT community here created a movement to fight for their rights and for our countrymen to recognize their voice, not just for being different but rather a voice to make a difference. The said movement was the 21st LGBT Pride March which was held on the 27th day of June 2015 in Luneta Park. With its theme “Fight For Love: Iba-iba, Sama-sama,” this effort aimed to put an emphasis on leaving a mark and a statement that their fight for LGBT rights is not a fight for LGBT rights per se but also a fight for human rights.</p>

			<p class="content">In a global survey, out of the 39 countries that was assessed, only 17 countries accept	 homosexuality including the Philippines which ranked 10th. In addition, according to the Pew Research Center, 73% of Filipinos in the legal age agreed that “homosexuality should be accepted by society”. But although some studies have regarded our country as one of the most gay-friendly nations, we do not have a government organization that focuses on the LGBT that is why the LGBT Community here solely raises their concerns and advocacies.</p>

			<p class="content">Some of the concerns, have already been heard specifically their fight for discrimination. An Anti-Discrimination Act was proposed and introduced by Hon. Kaka J. Bag-ao, District Representative of Dinagat Islands, in which it seeks to inform “that all person regardless of sex or sexual orientation must be treated the same as everyone else, wherein conditions do not differ in the privileges granted and the liabilities enforced”. Afterwards, the Anti-discrimination bill was conducted by the House of Representatives after the privilege speech of Representative Geraldine Roman, a first transgender elected in congress from 1st district of Bataan before the 17th Congress.</p>

			<p class="content">The LGBT –society labeled them “different” for their sexual orientations, gender identities, and a different concept of life and love. Because of this, it is as if they have been restricted and stereotyped to have lesser rights than any other people. Just like anyone else, they are just human: being and living like a human usually and normally do. They are just being themselves as they want to be. Being different does not mean you are not human to demand a right, but being different means you have to fight for your freedom to express, to love, and to live.</p>

			<p class="heading">A BULLET FOR JUSTICE</p>
			<p class="content">Killing, one of the greatest sin that a human being can do, yet killings in the Philippines nowadays are very rampant, it is easy as shooting an enemy in a game. </p>

			<p class="content">This issue in our country today can be a result of failed governance, corruption, drugs and other activities that may trigger a person to shoot others to stop what they are doing that are not in accordance of what is right. One example is about drugs, there are lots of latest killings and disappearances happened because of this. Since the “Change is coming” started, the “death squads” had started to advocate violent measures, that includes the killings of suspected criminals that is engaged to corruption, drugs, and criminality.</p>
			
			<p class="content">I am not saying that this is wrong, I am somewhat disturbed because what if those killed ones are just suspects that doesn’t have any wrong doings? What if they are innocent? In this way, Human Rights are not exercised well.</p>

			<p class="heading">HUMAN RIGHTS: A DUE PROCESS OF LAW</p>
			<p class="content">Human Rights. Just two words, but it is indeed broad. It has been many years ago since the Article 3 of 1987 constitution, known as the bill of rights, has been declared. But it is sad to say that numerous Filipinos are not aware of what this is. A corner in their minds is full of question marks asking and wondering about these things, or worse they don’t have any idea that these such things even exist. How can someone know what are the things he/she can do, and what are his/her rights as a Filipino Citizen, if he/she is not well introduced to the Bill of rights?</p>

			<p class="content">Human Rights are those that are essential for living. Any gender, color, race, nationality, state in life, age and the like, everyone has this right in order for them to live normally and peacefully at the same time. Right to live, justice, freedom, and speech are just the basics. There are more to be tackled in this website like the right for property, freedom of religion, right to information and many more. See? These rights serves as our manual on proper living here in our country, this will give us a great access to what are our rights as a human. </p>

			<p class="content">Violence against women (VAW) is a serious crime in the Philippines. It is a violation of human rights. There are laws that are made just to avoid this but it is still rampant these days. Maybe some people are still unaware of the consequences of committing this crime but we should stop this already.  </p>

			<p class="content">Men are considered as the head or the providers of the family and women support the husbands while taking care of their children.  This fact leads men to think like they can do everything. They thought that they have more power than women just because they are the ones who make them alive by working all day and giving them money for their finances. This unequal power relationship made an effect on how our society views about gender and sexuality.</p>

			<p class="content">Women’s participation in many organizations and activities are being recognized by other countries and we were even ranked as 9th on their most gender-fair list. Yes this is acceptable, but we can’t ignore the rapid increase of VAW case that was recorded by the Philippine National Police (PNP) in the past years.</p>

			<p class="content">Anti-Sexual Harassment Act in 1995, Amended Anti-Rape Law in 1997, Rape Victim Assistance Act in 1998 and Anti-VAWC Act in 2004 are some of the laws that our country implemented and fortunately, violent cases continued to decrease. Although lesser crimes are committed in the future, we cannot stay calm because they are still women and children that are experiencing the steel fist. More of them are not scared to speak up because they knew that our laws got their backs. In 2013, Western Visayas had the most VAW cases while ARMM had the lowest.</p>

			<p class="content">VAW are categorized in different categories: Physical, Sexual, Psychological and Economic. Anybody that is considered guilty in committing this crime will be imprisoned and they should give support to their victims if needed. Protection orders (PO) are allowed by the law for prevention to further abuse, it may be temporary or permanently. </p>

			<p class="content">Dignity is not the only thing that can be taken away to victims of this horrible experience; it can also cause our death.  Physical health, reproductive health, mental state and emotional state may be affected. Women should not be treated abusively; they also deserve love and respect. So we should put an end to this pathetic crime and let women stand confidently.</p>

			<p class="content">Philippines is a country where women can live without worrying about their rights. Unlike Southeast Asia, our country has many laws that can protect the Filipino women. Government already recognized them to be a part of our society. Filipinos have discovered kinship before the Spanish times. Legal equality and inheriting family properties for the rights of women has already been accepted. In 1990, education and literacy levels were higher for women. Even having women in important positions is now even new. Most of them have been senators, Supreme Court justices, cabinet officers, heads of major business enterprises and administrators of our country. They also contributed to the development of the Philippines. During the 1990’s era, 91% of the women were established in more than a commensurable share of many occupations even though they already predominated in terms of domestic service, 59.4% for the professional and practical positions, and 57.9% for the sales. Women were frequently preferred in assembly-type factory work. Two thirds of women from rural places were already migrating because of the availability of work in which women predominated. The other kinds of service compare positively with chances available to men. 64% of graduates were represented by women but 159 out of 982 career top executive positions were held in the civil service and only 15% of top-level positions were held in private sector.</p>

			<p class="content">Men usually downgraded household tasks to women and that makes things harder for employed women. But this burden is lessened somehow by the presence of relatives and servants who functioned as their helpers and caretakers but using them has occasionally been criticized as an equivalent to utilizing women to free others. Women have been the treasurer of the family that gave them power when it comes to money since the Spanish colonial period. The Spanish also started a tradition of lower-ranking women which is displayed in women’s acquiescent perspective and in a double level of sexual behaviour. However, it changed as time goes by. But still, the double level of sexual behaviour is still being challenged. In 1987, men superiority is also being challenged to some area. The law accommodates equal right even though it has the absence of particular provisions that might make it more effective. Divorce was banned during the early 1990’s and under some conditions, legal separation was legalized. Legal remarriage was not possible and the family code of 1998 was more liberal. The code authorized annulment for psychological disability, repeated physical violence or forcing to change religious or political affiliation. Divorce acquired abroad by an alien partner was acknowledged even though the laws of restrictive divorce might be observed as an action of breaking the terms of a law on women’s freedom to emerge from a bad marriage, signs were that many Filipino women observed them as protection against abandonment and loss of support by stubborn husbands. </p>

			<p class="content">Women are humans too. They are also a creation of God that can be useful to all of us.  Blessed by a voice that has a power to be heard and respected by many people.  Finally, there are laws that can protect them from all possible dangers.</p>

			<p class="content">According to surveys, women live much longer than men. They are denoting a form of social organization in which we are considered as the king. Filipinos are trained to respect women and this fact is demonstrated by public education where both men and women take place. Filipino women are accepted to be more reliable than men and some countries would not agree to this kind of belief.</p>

			<p class="content">Philippines is a good place for women to exist. Because this is a country where women are highly respected and they are treated as decent human beings. They can become anything they want and do things that we think that only men can manage. It is a place for mothers that are well-loved and that is the most important fact that the country have just for women. They can finally smile while having their family in their loving arms when they come home.</p>
